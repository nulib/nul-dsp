    "full_text": " September 8, 1961 Professor Richard Cramer 233 Home Economics Building University of California Davis, California Dear Professor Cramer, Betty Connors just called and asked me if I could send you some photos and info of and on Sam Hinton and enclosed is what I could dig up in the five minutes left before the week ends in my office. I hope this will be of help. Sam Hinton is one of America's foremost Rolk song singers. He accompanies him- self on guitar and other folk instruments and sings in a unique style. His rep- ertoire is up in the thousands and he is a recording artist on Decca, RCA Victor, and Folkways. He is particularly noted for his original style on the guitar, and for his children's songs and animal noises, He has appeared in 48 states and in Europe on stage, radio, and television. He is the one American folk artist who is the chief participant in the Annual U.C. Polk Festival at Berkeley (four so far). He has appeared twice in the last two years in Sacramento under the auspices of the Sacranento Folk Music Society to packed houses and excellent reviews. Hinton is not only a performer, but also an outstanding teacher, scholar, and spokesman for the field of folk music. Alfred Frankenstein of the S.F. Chronicle, a highly knowledgeable folk music critic as well as the leading. Bay Area music critic, writing about the recent Fourth Annual Folk Festival at U.C. at Berkeley said, \"No UC folk festival would be legal without Sam Hinton's humor, brilliant intelligence, and ability to play a mouth organ with no hands.\" During the9 1930's Sam toured the country with Major Bowes vaudevillé units and was one of the very first professional singers of folk song in America. Sam is the curator of the Museum=Acquarium at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, soon to be U.C. San Diego campus. He is a leading member of his profession as an oceanographer-biologist and has published a book for young people, \"Exploring Under the Sea\". He has also recorded folk songs for the Library of Congress Archives. That's all that I can think of off-hand. Good luck with the concert-I know it will be a great one. Let me know if I can be of any further assistance. Yours truly, BARRY OLIVIER Assistant to the Director, A.S.U.C.

    "scope_and_contents": "John Cage was already established as an influential American composer and important leader of post-World War II avant-garde music when he began his Notations project in the mid-1960s. In 1965 the Notations project was born. Cage sent letters to hundreds of composers, visual artists, and writers soliciting manuscripts for possible inclusion in a book to benefit the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts. Some sent Cage recent creations while others contributed older works. Cage published selections as Notations (New York: Something Else Press, 1969). In addition to the music manuscripts, the Notations collection includes much of the correspondence generated around this project. The collection offers unique insight into the notational practices developed by composers in the first two-thirds of the 20th century. Works by established composers, students, musicians, performance artists, visual artists, and writers are included in the collection.",

    "description": "Clipping for the San Francisco Chronicle of Ralph Gleason's interview with Donovan.",
    "full_text": " spacen 11/24/67 On the Town 'Stop Using Drugs And Seek the Sun' Ralph J. Gleason DOWN THE HOTEL corridor the sound of Dono- van's voice was softly audible singing a song I had not heard before. It ended and, in answer to a knock, the door opened and the gentle poet's curly head appeared. \"Make yourself at home,\" he said, and sat cross- legged on the rug before a tape recorder and ran the tape back to play again. Donovan's handshake is strong, his eyes clear and bright with a glint of green and his shoulders broad. His smile is sudden and brilliant and he ex- udes a quality that can only be called peace. * * ON THE TAPE RECORDER, his voice sang a song about Maharishi Maheshe Yogi in which Donovan's voice was multitracked over the words as the lyric urged the listener to \"let the Maharishi wisen you.\" Donovan sat on the floor and softly sang along with the tape, his head moving in time with the mu- sic. Ashley Kozak, his manager and friend, entered and Donovan turned to him to point out what a lovely word it was, \"poetically speaking.\" The tape machine whirred as Donovan looked for another song, this one a soft, warmly swinging ballad about youth and beauty and the grimness of cities \"It's a real DOWN town,\" Donovan sang. Again his voice joined the voice on the tape. When it was over I said, \"It's a beautiful song\" and he quickly agreed, \"It 'tis, isn't it?\" His voice al- ways has that faint tang in the sound which goes with his name. \"I wrote it in Los Angeles,\" he said. \"I was tuning my guitar to sound like a sarode and this chord came (he picked up his guitar to demon- strate) and then the next one. I found I could play jazz chord. I never had; I thought them too difficult. But I found I could.\" * * * KOZAK COMMENTED, \"He's been listening to all kinds of things. \"Billie\" (Billie Holiday). I'm an ex-jazz man and my wife is a jazz singer. When I first heard him, I thought of Billie, that sense of time.\" Donovan smiled and said, \"There's so much going on with me now,\" and ran the tape back to an- other track. \"These are from my next album,\" he said; \"two LPs actually, one for children. It will be out next week.\" The speakers let out sounds of birds and barn- yards and Donovan sang of elves' hands and fairy- tales and beauty and the shining joy of life. * D RRVV THROUGH the Haight-Ashbury today,\" he said. \"I didn't get out.\" One of his band mem- bers who had come in commented that he had gone shopping on Haight that afternoon and Donovan added, \"It's only a two-year scene, though.\" He had been shopping in Sausalito and showed his purchases -comic cigarette packages and a leather bag. \"There's so much energy being misdirected,\" he said. \"The energy that built the great civilizations, China, India-that could all be done again without drugs.\" The room had filled up with band members and Donovan's father, Donald Leitch, a smiling, portly man who gazed affectionately on his son. * * * D ONOVAN SHUT OFF THE TAPE. \"This has to be listened to when there's nothing else going on,\" he said as the music faded. \"Where's that piece of paper?\" he asked, referring to something he had been reading earlier. Eventually it was found and it turned out to be the text for his own statement in his new album. \"I call upon every youth to stop the use of all drugs,\" it read, \"and banish them into the dark and dismal places. For they are crippling our blessed growth Yes, I call upon every youth to stop the use of ALL Drugs and heed the Quest to seek the Sun.\" Donovan, who signed his statement, \"Thy hum- ble minstrel.\" buttoned his high-button shoes with a hook he carried in his jeans, reiterated the impor- tance of the generation now 14 and of turning them away from drugs and the violence of television. * * * THEN HE ROUNDED UP his band, his manager, his father and his visitor and went on out into the night, bubbling with laughter and smiles and carrying with him that air of peace and quietude one gets from a flower. It is no coincidence, it seems to me, that he writes, in his new album, \"With all the Love in my Heart/I bequeath this gift from one flower to many.\" Perhaps there's a clue in another line of his \"And so I sing my poems of the beauty I see that all may see and know the reassurance I know, that God IS love.\" Adults should listen to this young man who will beat Winterland tonight and tomorrow night. He and his peers speak more directly and effectively to youth than any other voice, in or out of formal churches. That it is a voice of peace says a great deal about the hope for the future.

    "full_text": " PRESS RELEASE-LEV SINGH A sophomore student at the University of California, Dev Singh is well known to Bay Area folk enthusiasts. Based in the Berkeley area, Mr. Singh has been singing publicly for three years. His singing material ranges from traditional to con- temporary blues, ballads and folk songs, as well as some orig- inal compositions. He plays a variety of folk instruments in- cluding guitar, autoharp, mouthbow and harmonica, and he also sings unaccompanied. Dev Singh's Indo-American heritage contributes to a subtle blend of the musical strains of India and America which are re- flected in his voice, song styling and repertoire. Mr. Singh has appeared extensively in the San Francisco and East Bay areas, singing over television, radio, and on the concert stage. A featured artist in folk festivals in Berkeley and San Francisco, Dev Singh was a performer at the Fireside Folk Festival Concert at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley. Since then he has appeared at coffeehouses and various other night spots in the East Bay area, and has also sung at the Greenwood Lodge Resort in Santa Cruz. In his volunteer work with the Red Cross, Mr. Singh enter- tains at the Oak Knoll Naval Hospital and the California School for the Blind as well as other East Bay schools and hospitals. Co-Founder of \"The Holly Branch\", Mr. Singh has helped provide a stage for local folk talent in a series of House Concerts in Berkeley. 11-10-5",

    "full_text": " FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (2/6/67) FROM: Wampler Tours, Box 45, Berkeley, California 94701 MEXICO BY RAIL---A RELAXED EXCURSION Imagine visiting a beautiful, almost untouched wilderness area--relaxing in an open gondola car on a private train--perhaps with your camera and lots of film. This unlikely sounding combination isn't a pipe dream--it's a pos- sibility open to just about anyone. From June 18 through July 2, Joseph Wampler, noted archeologist and tour leader, will again offer a special raid tour starting at San Francisco and swinging down through the Southwest, by the Grand Canyon, and then into the wild, little explored back country of Northern Mexico. Travelers may select starting points at many points in the West and Southwest. Full information and a free illustrated brochure are available from Wampler Tours, Box 45, Berkeley, California 94701. Mexico is a relaxed country and there is no more leisurely means of visiting there, than by rail. KA special excurssén train, with pullman accom- modations (travelers sleep in the same bed every night), has been arranged by Wampler--with several different rail lines providing the \"pull\". Rail buffs will be interested to know that this trip will cover the entire Chihuahua al Pacifico rail system of Mexico. Food for the tour members will be prepared right on the train throughout most of the journey, for the comfort of the tour group. Just a few years ago the pristine wilderness surrounding Mexico's \"Grand Canyon\", the Barranca del Cobre (Copper Canyon), was mostly inaccessible.

Other interesting facets of the tour will be visiting with several diff- homelands erent Indian peoples in their xxxxxxxxxxxgxx, seeing the important archeolog- ical ruins at Casas Grandes, shopping in small villages, visiting old colonial towns, and partaking in special fiestas, with musicians and entertainers. Joseph Carson Wampler, who had explored much of the wilderness covered by this tour, long before easy access was possible, says of railroading in Mexico, \"A rail tour is one of the most relaxing ways to travel, and Mexico is one of the most relaxingg countries to travel in. Even the trains travel more slowly in Mexico!\" KTour costs range from $472-=including most meals and Pullman equipment while traveling. Local travel agents and Santa Fe Railroad agencies can pro- vide further details--as can Wampler Tours, Box 45, Berkeley, California 94701. Whether one counts himself a photography enthusiast, sight-seer, railroad buff, Mexico aficionado, or one of those who values \"just getting away\", this excursion promises much and demands little. old and young are welcome--there are no unusual inconveniences or physical requirements--just a relaxed mood. # # # atsra slobaog aggo as galbivorq at zeiqmsw embs dexti add xol girs alda no bas e.d.T .SSIS sado fab BOASTISE sdd dguords gix3 edd 30 add galrob ISO -nol3IbbA bas galwelv rol ebivoxq Ifly 'arednem xuoJ xoi agoje Istoeqa ed ffitw stedd eylls (alsos Islaeqa add to saussed eIdlaaoq sbsm) -3316 dilw galslelv 9d IIIw IDOJ sda 10 adoos? and abnsismod -gofoodors sdj galsee rieds at astbal dasie Isknofoo bio ,293811tv IIsma at gatagoda , asbasx0 28265 3s ankux Isol bns enstoleum dalw Isloeqa at gablesisq bas add 10 doum bsxolqxs bad odw ,T9IgmsW MOBIS) digesol at gathsoxilsr to syss BSW 889008 yess stoled gool ,TUOJ alds rd at osizeM bas 03 sysw gaixsist from adj to eno at 2003 Itsx A\" ISVSX3 anisx add nev3 .nt Ieverj of ggaixsist deom adj 10 eno \":oolzeM at glwole exom Josequops mailing bas elasm 380m mor? 93081 23205 IDOTN -039 080 bsoxlish 97 adas2 bas adness ISVSIJ ISOOJI alkdw IOTAC ,2A xo8 ,23U0T xefgmsW aso as--sfisjeb redixul sblv bsoxIfax B soo reddedW alds \"\"yews 3013393 380[\" esulev odw 92003 to 9110 TO obsnototts oo.xxsM 916 Savor bas bio abnsmeb has doum 892kmozq notextoxe .boom boxsier S Isolayda TO IBUSUAU on SIS 4718-23-2 FROM: Tours, BOX 45, Berkeley California 94701 NEW RAILS TO OLD MEXICO A new way to see old Mesico is being discovered by an increasing number of American travelers--by railbod Railroading and Mexico go to- gehher--both operate at an old-fashioned, leisurely pace. With the com- pletion of northern Mexico rail lines through some of its most scenic wil- derness country, a direct route from the American Southwest into the heart- land of Mexico has been opened. Joseph Carson Wampler, pioneer excursion-leader (he first offered trail trips through some of this same country),;is once again planning a special rail tour to Mexico--a \"Leisurely Tour\"--this Rpring, February 18 through March 5, 1967. Special American air-conditioned Pullman rail equipment will be used throughout the tour to provide maximum comfort while visiting both the back. country and cities of Mexico. A free, illustrated booklet is available--with a day-by-day schedule of the entire journey--from Wampler Tours, Box 45, Berkeley, California 94701. Fiestas, Mariachi Bands, visits to the homelands of several Indian peoples of Mexico, colonial towns, vast stretches of wilderness, beaches, village shopping, and many other adventures await travelers--including two visits to Mexico City itself. \"A rail tour is one of the most relaxing ways to travel,\" Mr. Wampler points out, \"Mexico is one of the most relaxing countries to travel in. This is the second of a new series of tours to offer both of these features.\" But the leisurely pace is still the unique feature of this trip--\"as Wampler puts it, \"Even the trains travel more slowly in Mexico.\" Even so, only forty percent of the travel time will be spent traveling by train.

Mexico offers another world, right next door to ours. Joseph Wampler offers a sane, relaxed, well-organized (but not over-organized) excursion to the best parts of that other world. With fifteen years of experience in back-country trip leading, Wampler is sunique among those leading such tours. Tour members may join the party at various points en route-=including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Albuquerque, and E1 Paso. Tour cost ranges from $472==including most meals and Pullman equipment. Whether one counts himself among the photography enthusiasts, sight- seeing fans, railroad buffs, Mexico aficionados, or those who jue want to l get away from it all', this Spring \"Leisurely Tour\" by rail to Mexico holds a universal appeal. Local travel agents and Santa Fe Railroad agents also give information and make reservations for the tour.

Starting from the Pacific Coast (San Francisco& Los Angeles) and running through the Southwest (Albuquerque and E1 Paso), the spec- ial excursion train will swing down into Northern Mexico, and for the next eighteen days tour members will visit both cities and back-country towns throughout Mexico. A free, illustrated brochure is available--with a day-by-day sched- ule of the entire journey--from Wampler Tours, Box 45, Berkeley, Calif- ornia 94701. Colorful places along the way will include the Pyramid of the Sun at San Juan Teotihuacan, the Market Square at Guadalajara, the Beach at Mazatlan, Mexico City's varied sights, and many other famous and some not-so-famous spots throughout our neighbor-country, Mexico. Joseph Carson Wampler, a renown natural historian and famed tour leader, first started leading back-country excursions in Mexico four- teen years ago. Recently he began some rail tours into the back coun- try, and as a result of tour members' enthusiasm, has added this unique trip to his crowded schedule. He points out that Mexico is the ideal country for a leisurely tour--as the country's pace is delightfully easy- going. And winter is the best time of year to visit Mexico. nearly Tour members will sleep in the same Pullman bed/every night of the trip, with American-style food and water prepared right on the train for - More - , 20 xo8 BINOT I9IqmsW :MORY (22\\e\\II) STATIZMMI 804 LOTAe sharolfis5 A--00IX3M HOUOSHT SUOT JIA Wall taber to JISq gloss adj badsis al 83003 Itsx al wan galdisamo8 asiad xefgmsW dqssot jatgofoedous 081939V nariw -da% diguords ES VISIONE ,List qd \"oolxsM to TUOT dexth adj (aslagaA 80.1 Boostonert ma2) 38605 offlost add moxi galfierd ,SI PIBUT -09q8 and (casy is bas suprespod[A) 3aswd3oo2 edj dgpotda galamux bas add xol bas ount mwob galwa II.w alsoj crotexuoxe 1sk bas asidio dood dialy IIlw exeducm 1003 sysb meedigis 3xen .oolxsM goodguords aawoz -bedos ysb-qd-yeb 8 at studboxd ,9977 A -3H25 ,20 xo8 2UOT xslqasW moxi-- sxbing sda 10 sin to blastyl add sbulont fith YSW adj goofs 2908Iq Introlog .

Rail buffs, camera enthusiasts, sight-seeing fans, students and teach- ers--all will enjoy this special and entirely unique excursion into the fascinating country so near and yet so far from most Americans. Another interesting facet of the trip will be the visits planned to various In- dian tribes-and even a fiesta with one tribe.

Leaving from Fort Worth, El Paso, and other Southwestern points, the tour will travel into the remote areas of Northern Mexico via the recently completed Chihuahua al Pacifico railroad line. A combination of primitive, little-traveled country and the convenience and comfort of pullman rail accommodations, make this trip appealing to people of all ages. In its varied experiences, this tour offers everyone unusual and interest- ing activity: for those who love scenic beauty, there is the \"Copper Canyon, 11 Mexico's rival for our Grand Canyon; for photographers the unlimited offering of a natural area in relatively pristine condition; for railroad buffs, the opportunity to cover the newly-opened rail link and possibly the entire system of the Chihua- hua al Pacifico R.R.; for shoppers rare chances to buy in the back country; for those who just want relaxation, the ease and slow pace of this beautiful remote area combine with the uniformly comfortable accommodations (travelers sleep in the same bed each night of the tour) to make a perfect vacation. And, 2 days at Guaymas for deep-sea fishing opportunity or shopping and bus trip to Hermosillo and Kino Beach. This special tour is offered by the man who has pioneered rail tours into this beautiful Canyon Wonderland area.

Last Fall the first special \"Copper Canyon\" tour was inaugurat- ed and the response was one of great enthusiasm from the first travelers. Many remarked on the comfort and excellent planning of the trip, while all were awed by the extraordinary scenery. The native Indians of the \"Copper Canyon\" area live much as did their ances- tors of ancient times -- farming on the slopes (sometimes on up to a forty-five degree angle) and raising sheep and goats. These people are friendly and hospi- table to visitors, and sometimes a fiesta is encountered. Western journalist Maxine Atwater, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, took the trip herself and reported: \"It combined all the reasons people travel I saw rugged back country visited with shy Indians in their homes all the while we enjoyed Pullman quarters and good meals.\" Sunset Magazine praised the scenery of this trip: \"This is a trip for total sightseeing. You could easily spend all the daylight hours in an open vestibule just watching the landscape slip by.\" Wampler has planned the trip with exceeding attention to details: the primary scenic areas will be covered during daylight hours; bottled drinking water taken from Texas and supervised meals from our own diner in Mexico; special side-trips are available at various interesting points. Using the facilities of five different railroad lines, the tour will cover more than 2200 miles.

The Copper Canyon is Mexico's major scenic attraction, and is often compared with Arizona's Grand Canyon. This area has been known for years to mountaineer-archeologist Joseph Carson Wampler. When an engineering breakthrough opened a new link of railway through Mexico's rugged Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range, Wampler saw the great oppor- tunity for modern-day travelers to visit this beautiful, untamed back country-- particularly the incomparable Copper Canyon. Wampler, an independent tour leader, enthusiastically laid plans for a comfortable rail tour into this remote area-and he has already led several highly successful tours through the Copper Canyon. A new, special Copper Canyon rail tour, emanating from the Southwest, has just been scheduled for September first through seventh (September 1-7, 1964), taking just one week. Travelers will board special Pullman-outfitted cars at Fort Worth, San Angelo, Presidio, and El Paso, and travel via Santa Fe and Chihuahua al Pacifico lines, sleeping in the same bed every night. Furthermore, water and food will be stored and prepared right on the excursion train, especially for tour members. The most beautiful scenic areas will be traversed in daylight hours, and stop- overs at the key spots are planned. Photographers will make every day a field-day, and all will enjoy the unspoiled beauty of this rarely-seen country. The tour will cover more than 2,000 miles and will be personally conducted by Mr. Wampler. The Copper Canyon area is the home of the fabled Tarahumara Indians, who live in the high country, farming some fields on as much as a forty-five degree slope, and raising sheep and goats. These Indians live much the same as did their ancestors in this remote area. The Copper Canyon is even deeper than the Arizona Grand Canyon, and has more water and hence more vegetation and animal life. - More - some 220 2008 ,STOOT 10014 (wa\\os\\) SEASOR log YATWOOD \"MOYMAD 939900° 90 are KAMITAH WELL and earl 30 \"endeD Lab SOUSTISE\" 20 \"nongrist seqgo5* address 6978 blosd abro gatentad clarsed fier ent extract total at congress reggod edT word $001=100w is 10 MOBEY 1980 baseD of soosiun (the at has nears dgese& at exam so?

In a few years there will be hotels and thousands of visitors thumbing their guide books, but for the present this country is undeveloped. The tour will offer maximum comfort, for such an undeveloped area, through basing all operation at the Pullman-equipped excursion train. Railroad aficionados will appreciate being among early passengers to ride this newest of all major rail lines in North America. They will be aware that attempts were made for a hundred years before the accomplishment of completing this line through the mountains and canyons of the Sierra Madre Occidental, shortening the route from the Midwest to the Pacific Ocean. Places of call along the way will include historic El Fuerte, established in 1546 and a strong point on the ancient El Camino Real; Topolobampo, a deep water port on the Gulf of California, and Chihuahua, Togno (or Divisadero), Cuiteco, and Los Mochis. How did the first visitors to the Grand Canyon feel? What were the thoughts of the first travelers to the Great Yellowstone, when they gazed upon the now-world- famous panorama? If you have ever wondered what being somewhere ahead of the crowd felt like, this tour might interest you. A free, illustrated brochure about this country and the Copper Canyon special rail tour, starting from the American Southwest, is available from Wampler Tours, Box 45, Berkeley, California 94701. Further information may also be obtained either from your local travel agent or any Santa Fe office. Fares, including most meals, start at $183 (from El Paso; $215 from Presidio; $233 from San Angelo; or $242 from Fort Worth). Joseph Carson Wampler, mountaineer, archeologist, natural historian and tour leader, is a remarkable man. After graduation from the University of California, he served as one of the chief archeologists on a Palestinian expedition and his resulting book has been hailed as a masterpiece. He now devotes himself to writing and tour leading--primarily specializing in wilderness areas. # # # \"MOYWAO IU -100 sous magan edd ed filw apedmen \"weIr and telt 10 abbasuorid basesafted ed Iftw esedit 8769Y well ,III relib [fib strod sitt. 24 ******** extr. edd 701 ford epology :ebtog as doga 101 wt \"o'moo actest notesticke asian abid 03 grited [Liw edgredit dards exampled itte at copit Ifs 20. entI. to out 8 TOT ebsp out error to bace; edd .reesO officest edd. 04 edd mor22 at (adtress) a attention snefer [[so 20 (13) $'100 **** queb Bi the set or tatoq groute is bag so.1. bass ra) angoT has to 2,000 sucht ID erists stew date fies? baseD sd ad add 616 woth from-work exish naqy beseg with madre edg: at dart? add bworso eris to evertragos galed during bazebacon save eyed May 3.1. suppoint drigits, Birth del fabbaqa artic has adgith dunda 4,997° 4. was eswet reDipast/ at add - flyg more redd to benefits ed: cells WAR as me 24 the drais alsen than With 000 topas levers £800,C filterow morth siste TO mac 88$8 east 2458 total is most), 88.48 wordbox brue to digesol, ed In edd and sedia B. 82 add form 00 ribeques R (%) add to eno 0.0 beving brus at sereved wear all 8, As belled seed and load at ... 47-8-27-2 Copper cang##2 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (4/22/64) From: Wampler Tours, Box 45, Berkeley, Calif. 94701 FAR-AWAY PLACES IN NEXT-DOOR MEXICO Far-away places still exist in the world, and one of the nearest of them is in Northern Mexico-- spectacular and undeveloped wilderness area known for its \"Canyon of Copper\", the \"Barranca del Cobre\". The Copper Canyon is often compared with our Grand Canyon, and is Mexico's chief scenic attraction. But is is little known, even in Mexico itself. Only recently has a new railroad link through the forbidding mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental range been opened, making the B Copper Canyon area accessible to easy rail travel. This new rail line, along the Chihuahua al Pacifico Railroad, is remarkable as an engineering feat and also for its scenery. It is a fascinating trip for anyone curious to see for himself the remote and rugged homeland of the Tarahumara Indians. # Recently Joseph Carson Wampler, an independent archeologist-mountaineer, began leading excursion parties via rail, into this area. Wampler's railroad tours offer a combination of rugged back-country experience and modern, Pullman-equipped rail travel. Travelers sleep in the same bed through- out the trip, and food and water are stored and prepared right on the train in spot- less diners. The most beautiful areas are traversed in daylight hours, with stop- overs at the key scenic spots. For many yearsx Wampler has known this area, and has led pack trips into the AKEX Barranca del Cobre vicinity. When the new rail link was laid--replete with 39 bridges and 76 tunnels-Wampler saw an unprecedented opportunity for travelers of all ages and all degrees of stamina, to engjoy the fascinations and wonder of this remote and rugged wilderness area. He originated a series of tours into the area and the enthusiastic repponse has led him to increase the tours. - solie ,211 xo8 '99[qmsW : (da\\ss(s) ETAICEMMI HOT ODIXHM HOOD-TXHM WI 230A19 YAWA- ment to Jasteen edd 10 eno bas ,blrow edd at Jeixe litte aessiq ESWS-IS' TO'I aword SOTE beqo[svebau bas at at ast'to at raqgo edT [sb odd to moyas att JUE almeos Ietdo at bas basid TUO dtitw berisqmes beot[ist wen £ and Meeth ookxelf at neve at at need [sjnsbiooO erbal stret? and to anistauon edt discoult >ant Its% yese of eldissess SOIS noyaso TeqqoO 8 edd gafrism beneqo at ,bsorlisk oofftost Is edt groofs enti LIST wen atnT TOY qirt 6 at JI aft 201 oals bas tsel gatreentigne as as add 10 beaser bas stomer edd Meamiri 998 of enoves 016 ,TeIqmsW digesol EftnessA * .amstbnI ,BOTTS aids otal flast siv settisq notawoxe gathsel asged sonefreqxe boggur to B Tello bsor[.ST -riguord bed smsa edd nit .Levsr List beqgtups- ,resbom bas -Joga at new edd no tight betsqe't brss berode STIS TSJBW bas bool bas eight add Juo -gade ddkw Jdgffysb at bearevers 9T6 85076 Intitused deom adT seal ejoqa otness you add de STOVO add odat aqi% Nosq beI and bms ,SOTE eids aword asd TeIqmsW yasm \"O?] ddtw BEW inti Itst well edit nedW side0 feb SOCISTICE **** 20% as was as bas aggbird PE to febrow brs. anothentoes? end rotone of to Ifs bas aegs IIs to ed($ ofal and to 201798 B eH .80TS sseirrebltw beggur bas stoms abdt strod edd essent of mkd bel esd ord bns SOTE 17.8-281 Now he is planning for the Fall a special \"Copper Canyon\" tour, emanating from the Southwest, to run September 1 through 7, 1964.

Leaving from Fort Worth, E1 Paso, and other Southwestern points, the tour will travel into the remote areas of Northern Mexico via the re- cently completed Chihuahua al Pacifico railroad line. A combination of primitive, little-traveled country and the con- venience and comfort of pullman rail accommodations, make this trip appealing to people of all ages. In its varied experiences, this tour offers everyone unusual and interesting activity: for those who love scenic beauty, there is the \"Copper Canyon\", Mexico's rival for our Grand Canyon; for photographers the unlimited offering of a natural area in rel- atively pristine condition; for railroad buffs, the opportunity to COV er the newly-opened rail link and entire road of the Chihuahua al Pacifico (plus four other lines' rpads) for shoppers rare chances to buy in the back country; for those who just want relaxation, the ease and slow pace of this beautiful remote area combine with the uniformly comfortable ac- commodations (travelers sleep in the same bed each night of the tour) to make a perfect vacation. This special tour is offered by the man who has pioneered rail tours into this beautiful Canyon Wonderland area.

Last Fall she first special \"Copper Canyon\" tour was inaugurrated and the re- sponse was one of great enthusiasm from the first travelers. Many remark- ed on the comfort and excellent planning of the trip, while all were awed by the extraordinary scenery. The native Indians of the \"Copper Canyon\" area live much as did their ancestors of ancient times--farming on the slopes (sometimes on up to a people forty-five degree angle) and raising sheep and goats. These NXXXVEX are friendly and hospitable to visitors, and sometimes a fiesta is encountered. Western journalist Maxine Atwater, writing for the San Francisco Chron- icle, took the trip herself and reported: \"It combined allthe reasons people travel I saw rugged back country visited with shy Indians in their homes all the while we enjoyed Pullman quarters and good meals. Sunset Magazine praised the scenery of this trip: \"This is a trip for total sightseeing. You could easily spend all the daylight hours in an open vestibule just watching the laddscape slip by.\" Wampler has planned the trip with exceding attention to details: the primary scenic areas will be covered during daylight hours; all meals and water are prepared right on the train carrying the travelers; special side- trips are available at various interesting points. Wampler will personally conduct the tour. Using the facilities of five different railroad lines, the tour will cover more than 2200 miles.

Often compared with our Grand Canyon, this area is Mexico's chief scenic attraction, but is little known--even to those who live in Mexico. For years the vast canyons--deeper than those of the Grand Canyon--and moun- tains of the Sierra Madre Occidental range, have been accessible only by exhaustive travel--but a new railroad line has changed that. After a century of attempts and failures, a new link of rail was pushed through the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains from Northern Mexico to the United States border. A major engineering feat, the new line required more than seventy tunnels and a variety of bridges and other construction. The result is a new, practical means of travel to reach the Barranca del Cobre. This route is also among the most scenic and most untouch- ed by tourists and development, of any railroad line in the world. In 1963, an independent archeologist-mountaineer, Joseph Carson Wampler, originated a very special rail tour for interested travelers, personally guided a group on a circle-route kaik down through the Southwest, where the Grand Canyon of Arizona was encountered; then the party proceeded via the new rail line, down in Mexico, through the mountains and canyons of the Sierra Madre Occidental and through the Barranca del Cobre. The rail route then swung back up along the Pacific coast and returned over entirely dif- ferent lines, to the United States. Wampler is repeating this 'Canyon Wonderland\" rail tour this fall, November 8 through 22, and interested travelers are invited to inquire for full details. A free, illustrated brochure may be obtained from Wampler Tours, Box 45, Berkeley, California 94701. Naturally, this tour yeelds many and varied travel opportunities--phobography, sight- seeing, relaxation, shopping and study.

Railroad buffs enjoy being among early travelers over the newest rail link in North America. They also are enthusiastic about the fact that the trip--more than 3,500 miles-- is covered via five different railroads: the Chihuahua al Pacifico, Santa Fe, Mex- ican National, Southern Pacific, and the Ferrocarril Pacifico. Special fiestas and gatherings are planned in the small villages through which the train passes--and travelers will encounter the friendly and hospitable Indians of the Barranca del Cobre area, and also Mexicans in the towns and along the rail route. Ad- ditionally the trip passes through the homeland of the Navajo, Hopi and Mayo Indians. San Francisco Chronicle journalist described the trip, which she herself took, \"I saw rugged back country and swank resorts, visited with shy Indians in their homes and was entertained by Mexican villagers. All the while we enjoypolyed Pullman quarters and good meals in a spotless diner to me it combined all the reasons people travel.\" Sunset Magazine described the train ride: \"Children come running from almost every hamlet and out of almost every isolated hut to watch this train go past The vaquero gallop= ing alongside the tracks raises his hat in greeting; an old man leading a burro looks up; fields workers, the black-robed members of the Nennonite colony, pause to watch.\" Sunset Magazine continues, \"This is a trip for total sightseeing: You could easily spend all the daylight hours in an open vestibule just watching the landscape slip by. There are deep ravines with red rock walls, with waterfalls slipping over the rims, palms by and ferns growing tkx in the shade, bush poppies tumbling over slopes in the sunlight.\" Joseph Carson Wampler, mountaineer, archeologist, natural historian and tour leader, is a man of long and varied experience. After graduation from the University of Califor- nia, he served as one of the chief archeologists on an important Palestinian expexdition, and his resulting book has been hailed as a masterpiece. Since then he has authored articles and books, chiefly in natural history, and has devoted himself to making the S eggq - ODIXAM HOOT-TXEM VII SEOAIS YAWA-HAT add at qee[a 2760 moteur to SED dgsords ,&SSTS STS oakxell at boo't Ifs) 8980 gatato Istoeqa bas (qirt edt bad ORBE (nist) edd no bas beroja at statf [tax Jaewen edd Tevo KITBO groms sated votas afford beorfish --selfm 002,E madt edd Jedd Jost edt toods offestandtre e's oafs your .soitemA -XSM est STABS Is edd :absorList evil siv berevoo at [ITISSOTION edt brts assi sdid doldw segsIItv [1sma edd at benns[q 976 bas estaelt [stooge edt to ansibal bas edf redness [[tw STELSVSTJ atsw -bA .

The trip, directed by archeologist-mountaineer Joseph Carson Wampler, will run November 8 through 22--and interested travelers may ar- range now to be included. For many years Wampler has known of the beautiful wilderness area surrounding the Barranca del Cobre, Mexico's major scenic attraction. This undeveloped back country has only been accesssible by the most difficult travel until very recent times. In fact, Wampler has led trail and pack trips into the area for those with the interest and stamina to see it. But now, after a century of attempts and fail- ures, a new rail link has made possible easy rail traved to and through the Barranca area. The tour, as it was originated last year by Wampler, follows a circleproute down through the United States Southwest, into Mexico through the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains, through the Barranca del Cobre, and back up via the Pacific Coast to return to the United States. More than 3,500 miles are covered, over five different railroads: The Chihuahuax al Pacifico, Santa Fe, Mexican National, Southern Pacific, and Ferrocarril Pacifico. In addition to the Grand Canyon and the Barranca del Cobre, many other fax- cinating things are to be found: The trip passes through the homeland of four In- dian peoples--the Navajo, Hopi, Tarahumara and Mayo; Colonial towns rich in the history of the Americas--El Fuerte, Navojoa and Alamos; Fiestas, barbecues, swim- ming, singing and entertainment by folk musicians; and many more occasions for interest and enjoyment. solde \"sedigmsW smort STAICEMMI 929900 TO TEAV 2 nea mort beotlist \"bas[\"rebnoW normaD\" espirus B IISH aidT based edd 10 YSW rd gallevst bas JEEW etatoq Terito bas to novas0\" TO \"endo\" Isb belds't add of ,SHOSITA to novaso doesof entstwom-Jatgofoedos rd qqs enT bread 2'ooixeM -IS V.Sm bas-ss disports 8 Tedmevoli SINTI Iftw \"se[qmsW .bobyfont ed of won egast SOTE sold to award and STROT yasm TOT road beqo.levebau atnT othese Totam a'ooixeM ,97000 Leb SONSTICE edt KIev fitness lovert Jaom edd you need KIno esd dtkw seody not BOTTS edt otni aqiad Nosq bre list bel esd TelqmsW ,FOST al .29mLt -fist brus adquests to B 'st'ts worn JWB ...k 998 of satueta bas edd SOMETISH edd bas of list yese sfdfaaoq ebsm asd int list wen s .5978 B awollo? rd \"ESSY test betsgigtro asw Jt 86 \" Not edT STISIS end discoult oolxeM ound aetas betknU edd distroctif awob offtos9 edd siv qu losd bas Isb BONSTISE srid [stnebtooO TOVO berevoo 9°IS aelkm 002,£ asda STOM betinU edd of nuts of JasoD asolxeM ,94 sansa coolitost Is sdT : absorList Jastellib evil bas cottiost -sel redito you Leb SOUBTISE add bas baseD edd of notifibbs mL -III to bmsComori sdd 8988.8q qird edT bauot ed of 913 against gattsato edt nit dolr amount IstnoIo0 toyaM bas STIMMISTIST ,too colsvsil astb -miwa , ;coms[A brs sotovsk edt to projein 201 STORE youn bns tensiolam >[[o'] gd brs anigata ,gate has 47-8-31-1 MEXICO'S VAST CANYONLAND OF COPPER - Page 2 Full details and a free, illustrated brochure are available from Wampler Tours, Box 45, Berkeley, California 94701.

If you have ever wondered what it feels like to be somewhere ahead of the crowds of tourists, perhaps a visit to the Barranca del Cobre wilderness might interest you. In a few years there will be hotels and thousands of visitors thumbing their guide books--but for the present few Mexicans and fewer Americans even know of the existance of this \"Canyon Wonderland\".

This tremendous and spectacular engineering feat makes possible a 15 day circle railroad trip to include both the Grand Canyon and the Barranca del Cobre, Mexico's \"Grand Canyon\". Joseph Wampler of California, an independent Archeologist and Mountaineer, is organizing the first such rail trip, scheduled for early May of this year. Few would challenge the fact that the Arizona Grand Canyon is one of the world's outstanding scenic wonders. Say the same of the Barranca del Cobre, and few would challenge it, either--rather, most would ask, \"Where is it?\" Located in the Southwestern part of the Mexican state of Chihuahua, the Barranca del Cobre is the home of the Tarahumara Indians and is seldom seen by travelers. The Indians live in this high country, farm some fields on as much as a forty-five degree slope, and raise sheep and goats. They live much the same as did their ancestors in this remote back country. While the Arizona Grand Canyon is wider and has more variegated color, the Barranca del Cobre is deeper, has more water, and more natural vegetation and habita- tion. Both are awesome and beautiful. Tour members will be seeing Mexico's major scenic attraction in a rela- tively pristine condition. In a few years there will be hotels and thousands of visitors thumbing their guide books. This tour will offer maximum comfort for such an undeveloped area. The Santa Fe Railroad will make up a standard Pullman equipped train for the excursion. Tour members sleep in the same bed every night of the trip. Food and water will be stored and prepared on the train itself. The trip will include a two day stopover in the mountains near Divisadero, at a mountain village, where the travelers will join the local people at a big SOAK ODIATI TT YAYIIAH WEN If got 06/2009 is audition and problem aypoin erid to one ankedratom eifj discounts drill adi elotto VPD 2 is ofdlesse Jack bas sint for CONSTITES odd brs magnet) Based oil door ebclont of qiso because - 20 Exam equat fist dose edd and at bas this its you 20 9 beturberios To 9,10 at baseD applications dhild Jest off eguettado blood WST Jeb sometime edd to easa. odd: VSR arebook states ethCrow esid plan $20.00 400 bas to edaya erté .30 dream ord bedsooI mobias al bas erid edd et Tab srid agoe date extract over enterbert er!! ind nood you addos bas quede eater 600 saqpie serges 2 tast donta 3.0' no exclusion plosd edumer alds sterid b.t.b as error edd discuss over ent $70400 STORE robiwiel bread montza ord -stided bas nothedeger Lender store retion drop mad traqaeli by and Lob Details brs euroeavis ets days sactile =sfat is at coldostitis satese ed bradder abasemorid bas efedor! ad. exend D at enforce 70230 SENT sebood abida starts goodmark to brebaste D car exise 0'I ..... begoIsvébru AS done 967 bed couse prist at goals and 202 riking begglepa edit no bria benoto, ed book side to diffic frove the silf pl reveneds tali our B fillw atra ent gid to elqoeq [sool. only not $5.00 said Steffer k696EIfv extedition is do 47.8-32-1 - 2 - camp fire fiesta and hope that some Tarahumara folk instrumentalists will happen along to play some of their haunting music. Yes, there will be some thrill of adventure these first few years. Tour members will need plenty of film, black and white and color, to capture some of this beauty. Few can name a two-week trip the equal of this in photo- graphic opportunity. Here is form, patterns, color, and fascinating human interest Railroad aficionados will appreciate being among the first to ride a com- paratively new link in the Chihuahua al Pacifico Railroad, although they will be aware of the fact that this represents the third attempt in the past century to push this road through the mountains to shorten the route from the Mexican Midwest to the Pacific Ocean. In addition to this road and the Santa Fe, the tour will travel three additional lines--Mexican National, F.C. Pacifico, and the Southern Pacific--a total of five different railroads. Beyond the mountains, dropping down to the foothills and the maritime plain, the tour reaches the ancient town of El Fuerte, which was established in 1546 and was a strong point on the historic El Camino Real. Subsequently the tour encounters Navojoa and then Alamos, an even older colonial town of the El Camino Real. There is much more to the tour--including fiestas, barbecues, swimming, singing, and entertainment by Mariachi Bands. The tour schedule calls for departure from San Francisco and Los Angeles on May 4, and, then on to Williams, Arizona (where Easterners will join the party), the Grand Canyon, El Paso, Chihuahua, Togno (or Divisadero), Cuiteco, El Fuerte, Navojoa, Alamos, Guaymas, Hermosillo and Nogales before winding up at Tucson, Williams, Los Angeles or San Francisco, according to individual itineraries. How did the first visitors to the Yosemite Valley feel? What were the thoughts of the first travelers to the Grand Canyon when they gazed upon the now-world-famous panorama? If you have ever wondered what being somewhere ahead of the crowds felt like, this tour might interest you.

Under the direction of Joseph C. Wampler, distinguished archeologist-mountaineer, the group travelled by rail over five separate railroads and covered some newly accessible parts of Mexico's most beautiful remote areas. Due to the enthusiastic response to the trip, Wampler has announced plans for a special Fall return tour, Oc tober 26 through November 3. It is always news when a new stretch of railroad opens, and es- pecially when the opening brings with it new accessibility to little known and scenic country. Recently the Chihuahua al Pacifico Railroad completed the extension of its line through the mountains and canyons of the Sierra Madre Occidental. After two unsuccessful attempts over the past hundred years, a tremendous and spectacular engineering feat-- including the construction of more than seventy tunnels carved out of solid rock formation-has made it possible to travel Q. circle-route by rail to include both the Grand Canyon of Arizona and Mexico's Barranca del Cobre. Little known to Americans, the Barranca country is widely consid- ered the finest scenic attraction in all of Mexico, and rail fans and outdoors enthuslasts heartily welcome the opportunity to visit it. Located in the Southwestern part of the Mexican state of Chihuahua, the Barranca del Cobre is the home of the Tarahumara Indidns and is seldom seen by travelers. The Indians live in the high country, they farm some fields on as much as a forty=five degree slope, and raise sheep and goats. They live much the same as did their concestors in this undeveloped area. The tour passes through the homeland not only of the Tarahumara In- dians, but abso that of the Navajo, Hopi, and Mayo Indians. During the first tour, Wampler showed the Indian villagers films he had taken earlier 0$ themselves and their villages- and they were fascinated. The Indians came from miles around to see themselves--and were particularly delighted when the battery-stored electricity began to run down and they saw them- selves in slow motion. - More - I ,24 xoa T9SqmoW morr (Ea\\OI\\d) 3243138 3TAIC3MMI 907 YATHUOS XAA ODIXAM 2JIAR WEW dood 00jx9M art b990jqx9 MODITAMA to quore a sob ent bnd jojmsblooO gabok 077912 ont to UTTSWOO to mottoorjb grs 79bnU bronD\" a'oojx9K bolloo motto ,99000 quore out ,99/qmow .) riggeol USWEST 9M08 5999000 bro absorjior 93070q98 goit TOUO Stor ud ballousts 9/1 of SNO .80970 STOMST surftwood teom e'oojx9M to 2570q 9jdj889000 D 709 espia and 99/qmow 19543 911 of 98500889 offenjeuring as 19dat 50 ,Twot newsgr 5507 Jojaaqa -89 bno , 8,19 90 10091109 to W9S D ayous at II 933335 of WSW 33 Atjow againd ast storias 0550309q bookjjo8 00391209 so 9513 039902 bsto sword bro eajoisusom 9AT ands 213 to notametx9 945 TOUO asametio out TINTA Jojn9bjoo0 9TboM 079918 9NT to --109° patroonigno bno o borbawsi j80q 9MT to two boutoo ejensus non't 9TOM to 9st pribulost yd D Security of jj abram a. door biloe e'oojxen bno onosjik to bnot a 941 stod abusons of 5309 .99do) Sob -bianos as 911 of swort 953333 bno anot 1309 bro ,003x98 to ssd as softoortio teanst 9stt b979 ,33 jjeju of snt 48559094 standending 2900bjuo 9.1$ to stoje noojx9M 95$ to 1909 ovit STS betoool mobiss as bro enbibil ont to 913 as 97003 Job 9mog moot yous grit sis gujs enolbni SAT +87919009$ yd 5998 .stoop DRO agasis 92109 bro 1990/8 999096 a 8D down 80 so abjojt .0990 boqojgusbru ejds st qjont brb 8.0 SALDS 2AT down 9035 VISAT -STI snt to usno for bnofsmod and riguorit 898809 wot DNT 9513 printed I oyoM bro totoooll gdt to tont oado twd enojb 1935909 bod 9A amist notbal art beworia 79/qmoil Twot SAT befonlgeor 979w vosit bno-espollto bro 20 bsjdgjjsb 919W 998 of bauoto 8913m most 9500 -morit WDE can bro swob SW of roged grit .noitom wose 513 890/98 970M - 47-8-331 - 2 - The Fall tour will offer maximum comfort, even in the most primi- tive back country. Special Pullman cars will stay with the tour over all five railroads- and travelers will sleep in the same bed throughout the tour. Food and water will be stored and prepared on board the train. During the nine-day trip, more than 3,500 miles will be covered--includ- ing mountains, canyons, and beach areas. Five separate railroads will be traveled--The Chihuahua al Pacifico, Santa Fe, Mexican National South- ern Pacific, and the Ferrocarril Pacifico. Fiestas and street folk mu- sicians will be encountered several times, and the trip will afford many excellent opportunities for photography, shopping, and of course, relax- ation. \"The canyons and the mountains are at /their finest in the Fall\", Wampler says, and he points out that the weather is best at that time of year in the Southwest. Travelers will find the Grand Canyon of Arizona is wider and has more variegated color, while the Barranca del Cobre is deeper, with more water and natural vegetation and habitation. At the conclusion of the first tour the tour members were extremely enthusiastic about the scenic country, excellent accommodations, sparse- ness of tourists, colorful fiestas, and friendly people all the way. Many people have wondered what the first visitors to California's Sierra Nevada Mountains must have felt, a century ago, when they gazed upon the vast panorama, then unknown, to the world. If it's ever appeal- ed to you to be there a hundred years ahead of the masses, this tour might interest you.

After various attempts over a period of a hundred years, the Chihuahua al Pacifico Railroad of Mexico constructed more than seventy tunnels and performed the spectacular feats of engineering necessary to open the new line through this rugged Mexican back-country. Earlier this year the first rail tour ever to travel a circle-route encom- passing both major canyons was led by the distinguished archeologist- mountaineer, Joseph Carson Wampler. Wampler's group consisted of travelers from various parts of the United States. They traveled through the American Southwest, down into Mexico, and back along the Pacific Coast to their point of origin and return, San Francisco. In response to the interest and enthusiasm of the first tour group, a Fall trip is now being organized to cover the same territory, October 26 through November 3. This tour will cover more than 3,500 miles and travel on five different rail- roads. Travelers can compare Arizona's Grand Canyon, well known to millions of tourists, with Mexico's Barranca del Cobre, which is almost unknown to tourists. Deeper than its Arizona neighbor, the Barranca del Cobre is characterized by its abundant water supply and verdant growth. The area is inhabited by the Tarahu- mara Indians, who live much as did their ancestors, farming and raising small livestock--and growing some crops on as much as a forty-five degree slope. The tour also passes through the homeland of the Navajo, Hopi, and Mayo Indians--and special arrangements have been made for the tour to coincide with -More- (804210) SCANJER SOT W00 UTAR bats and is door and '10 owl West to and holling haddo) endo lob SOPOTISE alcohol electron the sun is 2 galanda eits 00 allow w sidinazors to Bolton 03 ISVO adopt order assets nade estart to beoulion corriest Le add hosbind of the ates) only bearpy rigueste salf West edo dego is formit of seve avoid (les derti 030 TRAY airs one hid bed can going died 2013 arelovest 20 goods wellerow our and belovest beth eat 20 118.8 Los alaina to shipq of 40050 gaula his is end 25 the 650 69 ex as and and dovos of gaind wen ei give 11st 4E rednewol after over no Levend bes pethy 00216 north error 26/03 good whit to 07 his been energies neo ashgon of at Iso consent footxell deter 038 not as entico Lab and eff and 6/4 w el 4500 eat Individual creation bow 2.0mm bus inki bis is does SVIL other grant BD doms is no acoro elige submit even 502 clook rotovin edd 20 subject and discount assang defin must ent Kits of one 201 show need aved administrative fallery's 47.8-341 -2- Wampler Canyon Rail Tour (Continued) some special Festivals among the Indians. A high point of the first trip occurred when Wampler showed the Indian villagers at one station some motion pictures he had made of themselves and their country--and the Indians came for miles to view the movies. The batteries, stored on the train, then began to run down and the In- dians enjoyed the films even more in slow motion. This Fall's tour will offer a maximum of comfort, even in the primitive back- country areas. Special Pullman cars will travel with the tour on all five rail- - roads--and travelers will sleep in the same bed throughout the tour. Water and food will be stored and prepared on the train, especially for the group. The five separate rail lines to be employed during the nine-day trip will be the Chihuahua al Pacifico, Santa Fe, Mexican National, Southern Pacific, and the Ferrocarrial Pacifico. Fiestas, street musicians, and general celebrations will coincide with the tour at several points, and the entire trip will offer spectacu- lar photographic opportunities (the best scenery being passed during daylight hours.) Shopping opportunities will be especially good in the more remote Mexican villages along the route planned. General relaxation of pace and attitude are guaranteed. Railroad aficionados will enjoy being among the first to ride the new rail lines through the Barranca del Cobre area. Outdoor enthusiasts will marvel at the spectacular beauty of the canyons and primitive condition of much of the country- - side. Those interested in Indians of the Americas will have an unusual opportunity to travel through the homelands of four Indian peoples.

Count them, but don't forget one almost in your own back yard. It's hard to believe that only a few hundred miles south of the Mexican border sprawls a primeval wilder- ness inhabited by indigenous Indians that is unknown--even to the Mexicans.\" Thus wrote journalist Maxine Atwater of the San Francisco Chronicle shortly after returning from Joseph Wampler's \"Canyon Wonderland\" Rail Tour. The area Miss Atwater writes of is the Barranca del Cobre (Mexico's \"Grand Canyon\") area in the Southwestern part of the Mexican state of Chihuahua. The indigenous Indians are the sturdy Tarahumara, who live in the canyon and its environs, farming some crops on as much as a forty-five degree slope. Wampler, best known for summertime trail trips through the Sierra Nevada, has recently pioneered this unusual conducted rail tour, covering primitive, little seen country via comfortable train travel. The \"Canyon Wonderland\" tour follows a circular route through the American Southwest and Northern Mexico. Travelers visit both the Arizona Grand Canyon and the Barranca del Cobre. Five separate rail lines carry travelers on the 3,500-mile tour, including a new link or rail through the mountains of Mexico's Sierra Madre Occidental. A special nine-day tour of this country will be offered during Easter Week, March 21 through 29. Travelers will embark from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Williams (Arizona), and El Paso (Texas). Fares begin at $320 including sleeping accommoda- tions and almost all meals. Many students and educators will take advantage of the Easter Vacation timing of the trip. Journalist Atwater further described her trip, \"I saw rugged back country and swank resorts, visited with shy Indians in their homes and was entertained by Mexican villagers. All the while we enjoyed Pullman quarters and good meals in a spotless diner \"...to me it combined all the reasons people travel.\" Response from - More - more 427140 :14 smost (CALASS) SEALING STATESMME FLOT HOAR CITY Technical vd and bit fitte o'to Hads only a dist STS 2808.0q woll\" eyelfod of board : ink Nord thro that 11.1 scomin $00 493702 diach dad Levening a rebaid oil 20 Adros. 20 film in $5.00 st oil nib dads seen bitorosis and to teasidA sudi 6919 air 42007 agenci word 78346 at 5978 (\"moyos) 60070 oadol feb possible get at to potter ISJENGA selM ed? to edete ed# to drug only emos Ban Moyner adj st.

Further details and a free, illustrated booklet are available from Wampler Tours, Box 45, Berkeley, California 94701. Naturally this tour yields many and varied travel opportunities--photography, sight-seeing, relaxation, shopping, and study. The tour passes through the homeland of the Navajo, Hopi, Tarahumara, and Mayo Indians. It also covers historic, early- day Mexican colonial towns, and many seldom-visited places. The awesome comparison of the Grand Canyon, wider and more variegated in color, with the Barranca del Cobre, deeper and more verdant, is now possible in the space of a few days--thanks to modern travel and the coordinating ingenuity of Joseph Wampler. Special arrangements have been made for the tour to coincide with Indian festivi- ties and colorful Mexican celebrations--including mariachi bands and Indian folk- instrumentalists. Railroad aficionados will enjoy being among early travelers of the newly opened rail line of the Chihuahua al Pacifico Railroad. Additionally four separate rail lines will be used--the Mexican National, Ferrocarril Pacifico, Santa Fe, and Southern Pacific--but the Pullman cars will be the same throughout the trip. Joseph Carson Wampler, mountaineer, archeologist, natural historian and tour leader, is a remarkable man. After graduation from the University of California, he served as one of the chief archeologists on an important expedition to Palestine, and his resulting book has been hailed as a masterpiece. Since that time he has authored important articles and books, chiefly in the field of natural history, and he has devoted himself to the organization of tours throughout the West. The unprece- dented success of the \"Canyon Wonderland\" tours has taken an increasing amount of his time, but Wampler continues to personally lead many tours each year--in the moun- tains and through various back country areas of the West and Mexico. # # # S 9389- vittle XOAE daily has mead and estab od only 11.1 event ody SG acced organ color of religment bodymong con chance 6012 officitive 979 deflood COOTH a base 2015 000E forest beltov Date View shield 2003 atto ord dipports againg 200$ out youds pas 107 DISVOD bale 3I byall ban too edit to ed) you boto property Tab gended Dab out ml ben progred 20 creebon 05 will a 10 easqa end (ii) you el education 953 zegpet diposot 30 whipper odt Deer Levars of word adid 20% alyan hood ever vollow rathet bas doged gretter pikely help pait 20 gritting gated votre III cobamobatte is adj to cast 7187 adj continues gill-bear ed bonit Item old aman edt oci tits ed produce cr place - rood Date Casuten 498740 Agency on 10 edt most was at crebest contienter of its DO Saldo eald n and 5@ bevise the and emitsh test sarco $ EB beltes sand and Good and been Lass company 70 set all spoked Bas description barodjus OIT stasw out doodyword exped to add of bedoveb part off \"to dates saled and gover edd 20 bedneb ed) dose 07003 your bsef of separation and all bus deaW odj so 28916 blood avoiesy bits enter 47-8-35-2 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (1/15/64) From: Wampler Tours, Box 45, Berkeley, Calif. 94701 \"Easter Week Special\" Canyon Wonderland Tour Reg 5 EASTER WEEK TOUR TO MEXICO BACK COUNTRY Modern civilization touches some of the oldest peoples and traditions of North America, when the \"Canyon Wonderland\"Xxxc Rail Tour travels its circular route through the American Southwest and into Northern Mexico's wilderness back country. After two highly successful previous tours, Joseph Wampler has arranged a special Easter Week tour designed to coincide with the vacations of students, educators, and others. Saturday Travelers will embark from San Francisco/March 21 and spend nine days aboard a special excursion train covering more than 3,500 miles, returning Sunday, March 29. (Tour members may also embark and debark at Los Angeles; Williams, Arizona; and Fl Paso, Texas). The tour will explore the primeval wilderness of the Barranca del Cobre area, the Barranca del Cobre itself (often called \"Mexico's Grand Canyon\"), Arizona's Grand Canyon, earlysky-day Mexican colonial towns, and many other fascin- ating scenic and historic country. This loop route rail tour has only recently been made possible by the opening of a new rail link through the mountains and canyons of Mexico's Sierra Madre Occi- dental. After a century of attempts and failures, the Chihuahua al Pacifico Railroad succeeded in completing this last link of rail-in itself a major engineering feat including the construction of more than seventy tunnels carved out of solid rock form- ation. Little known to Americans (or to Mexicans, for that matter), the Barranca country is widely considered the finest scenic attraction in all of Mexico. Joseph Carson Wampler, distinguished archeologist-mountaineer-natural historian, has known the area for many years and has led hiking and trail trips into the area before the rail trip was feasible. Now both rail fans and outdoors enthusiasts heartily welcome the oppor- tunity to visit this legendary country. - More - rotile ........ 21 8 towoT : HOT WOT moyast \"Istoeq8 >(es W YATNUOS XOAS ODIXHM HUOT X33W dition to bas aelgosa JeebIo ort to SMOR educat aft BISTENT DOT fish novaso\" sit nedw ,softemA blood otnet bas naolremA add [stasqe & begastis esd TelqmsW dq evolverq Colleasous yidghi owd Tejta extrebute to anoldsost edlt dttw obtontos of benglash suod >seW rejest assetto bas bisods aysb eats brege brie ES as? not't [[hw STSIOVSTT .PS dorseM tsbare antrader madt STOIT gatrevos abset [sibeqa B 17 bas {ANORITA amstirew soil to >tadab bas oals your stedmen \"NOT) leb BOUSTISH and to azerrebI.ww [sveming erit STOLqxe IIbr wot edT .

The Tarahumara Indians who inhabit the Barranca area are agricultural, farming some fields on as much as a forty-five degree slope, and raising sheep and goats. They live much the same as did their ancestors in this un- developed area. The tour has received wide acclaim, and journalist Maxine Atwater of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote shortly after returning from the tour, \"To me it combined all the reasons people travel.. saw rugged back country and swank resorts, visit- ed with shy Indians in their homes and was entertained by Mexican villagers. All the while we enjoyed Pullman quarters and good meals in a spotless diner.\" It is because of the popularity and demand for the tour that Wampler has added to his all- ready crowded schedule this Easter Week Special. Five separate railroads will be traveled-the Chihuahua al Pacifico, Santa Fe, Mexican National, Southern Pacific, and the Ferrocarril Pacifico. However, the same pullman cars will travel over all five roads. Fiestas and street folk musicians will be encountered several times, and the trip will afford many opportunities for photo- graphy, shopping, study, and of course, relaxation. The tour passes through the homeland not only of the Tarahumara Indians, but also that of the Navajo, Hopi, and Mayo Indians. During the first tour, Wampler showed the Indian villagers motion pictures he had taken on earlier trips, of them- selves and their village. Needless to say, the Indians were fascinated and came for miles--and were particularly delighted when the battery-stored electricity began tb run down, and they saw themselves in slow motion.

    "description": "Typed letter from Jerry Wallace to Barry Olivier with a run-down of procedures for concessions at the Berkeley Folk Music Festival Jubilee Concert, including a diagram of the Greek Theatre showing locations of stands, dated July 17, 1966",
    "full_text": " July 17, 1966 Dear Barry: As you requested last Friday, here is a run-down of the proce- dure for the drinks at Jubilee Concert. Drinks must be ordered from Coca Cola--TE 2-7020--several days before the event. They may deliver on Saturday, but plan on delivery Friday to be sure. Have them deliver tanks and dis- pensers to Linen Storage. If they put the dispensers and the C02 cans in the back room where the China and silver is kept there will be amole room for all the equipment. This year (1966) we used three stands, manned by two people each; and went through close to 40 tanks of drinks. We ordered 25 tanks of Coke and 15 of orange, and there was no orange left. Any unused tanks can be returned for credit, so it is better to overestimate. We also ordered cups--7 oz, I believe--from Coca Cola. Any unused cartons of cups can also be returned for credit. We changed 15d for the drinks. Possibly 20 d could be charged, but I think 25d is too much, as the drinks are small and the Coke may tend to be mostly foam. If one or two more stands were set up, it would greatly relieve vhe pressure on the stands. One stand was busy from 2:00 to 4:30 without a break, usually with a line. It was quite a hassle to keep up, and also quite tiring to go that long and that fast without a break. For the stands, we used the long narrow tables which were obtained from Grounds and Buildings. In the two lower locations, 2 tables were used, in a \"V\" shape, with a barrier extending out from the point of the V so we could serve both price ticket- hollers without them section hopping. The upper stand was one table backed up aginst a stone bench. Provision must be made for ice--and lots of it. As the Coke gets warm, not only is it less appetizing, but it foams pro- fusely and is difficult to get a full cup, and this slows un serving considerably since people insist on a full cup for their money. We emptied the ice machine in the Bear's Lair 1-2-2N ddes STL FINT :YTT#& TBEC ⑉000%0 edt to B al sted feef beteeupst JOV EA JI90000 selfder ts adalth edt TOP STUD aveb ET-8.00 8005 mort ed term analya no asia terd eyabautee no revileb year verT edt eroied ⑉815 bas exist revifeb modif SVSH ed of rebirt Frevileb edt bas edly time verif II menth of 8798090 tye> st Tevita bas saldo erit error MOOT load erit at 8080 soo add [f8 TOI moor eloms ed filw stedl elooea owt gd benness tabasja beatr ow (ddes) TROT afnT ow to exact 01 of 08010 discount tnew bas :dose fiel of BSW stedt bas Regasto to as bas to collist as refied et It 08 rot bennuter ed MSD adnet beautiful you mort--evelled I ,so berebro oals eW .etemijeerevo of beautift ed oals 088 aque 10 besuass VIA BLOO BOOD bos enj TOX ber begasrio eW offboto TOT edt 8.8 ,down oot at bas I twd begisdo ed 51000 ameo vIteom ed of bast ₹BM eNoO edt bas [Isme 9TB evellot bloow If east Jea BTOW abaste OTOM owf TO eno II of 00:5 MOTI yaud 88W baste ego erit no STUDBOTO env eleead 8 ettup BBW II B dttw vilsuer Essard B foodfiw 08:15 dant dedt bas 300£ tedt 03 of galatt ejtup 0818 bas equ geer of Neerd B foodttw STOW doldw aeldst WOTTSN anoI ent beau ow edd TOH TOWOI owt edt aI bas MOTI bentetdo salbretze TOTITED B djtw esqade \"V\" B at ebeau STOW aeldst S -Jedolf dido OVT08 blues ow 08 V edt to Jaloa edt morT +sso ento BRW baste reagy enT salagod dolloos medit thod stellod doned enote B Jaming an beroad elded eNoD edit aA ,41 to afol bas--- IOI ebem ed ferm motelvott -0°C amsol It fidd seel It at vIno for ades awola ain't Bus equo IINI S Jeg of el bas VIeant ro2 also IIN 8 no Jakant eIgoea earb yIdarebfanco galvies TI IteJ add at onldoom est edd beltame 9W . Itedt us-5-la and ran out in two hours or less. Ice is also available in the kitchen behind Pauley Ballroom, but there are no facilities for keeping it ice at the Greek Theater perhaps sending some one back to the Union about 11/1/1 hours into the concert to get a new supply; getting ice chests up at the Greek to store it in; or the use of dry ice could be used. Something has to be worked out, whatever it might be. Adequate change must be on hand--at least one roll each of quarters, dimes, and nickles, 10-$1's, and a $5 or two at each stand-=more if possible. Provision must also be made for taking care of the bills as they pile up, as it was thinking about getting windy, and if it did, it could be a big problem. The best answer would be to have someone free to collect them as they mount up and put them into the main cash box. Also, don't forget to have muffin tins as each stand for change. There are two in Linen storage, and 1 imagine any more needed could be scrounged somewhere. Volunteer help could be used, but If eel there should be one responsible paid employee at each stand, and that any volunteer help which might be used must understand they are there to work not to play around and see the concert. The workers will not see very much of the program, especially if it is a hot day. It would also be nice to provide chairs for the stands so the workers can sit down if they get a free moment. The ASUC truck is supposedly available to trans port the stuff from the Union to the Greek, but don't count on it unless you take the keys a few days in advance. I had signed up for it and when I arrived Monday, found it gone and was most unhappy. Count on using your own transportation to get the stuff moved and back, and if the truck is by some chance there, you're just that much ahead. We got there at noon and were set up andr ready to go at 2:00, using two big cars and a Kharman Ghia. The truck would speed things up considerably. I have enjoyed working with you the past two years, and I hope to see you next summer, and allso so metime in between. Thanks for everything.

The majority of the photographs were taken in Chicago, Illinois and the surrounding area, with a few in other cities and international locations. Sullivan documented nearly all of the photographs and slides in this collection in detail with bus or train numbers, route numbers, street intersections or stations, and dates.",

    "scope_and_contents": "John Cage was already established as an influential American composer and important leader of post-World War II avant-garde music when he began his Notations project in the mid-1960s. In 1965 the Notations project was born. Cage sent letters to hundreds of composers, visual artists, and writers soliciting manuscripts for possible inclusion in a book to benefit the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts. Some sent Cage recent creations while others contributed older works. Cage published selections as Notations (New York: Something Else Press, 1969). In addition to the music manuscripts, the Notations collection includes much of the correspondence generated around this project. The collection offers unique insight into the notational practices developed by composers in the first two-thirds of the 20th century. Works by established composers, students, musicians, performance artists, visual artists, and writers are included in the collection.",

    "scope_and_contents": "John Cage was already established as an influential American composer and important leader of post-World War II avant-garde music when he began his Notations project in the mid-1960s. In 1965 the Notations project was born. Cage sent letters to hundreds of composers, visual artists, and writers soliciting manuscripts for possible inclusion in a book to benefit the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts. Some sent Cage recent creations while others contributed older works. Cage published selections as Notations (New York: Something Else Press, 1969). In addition to the music manuscripts, the Notations collection includes much of the correspondence generated around this project. The collection offers unique insight into the notational practices developed by composers in the first two-thirds of the 20th century. Works by established composers, students, musicians, performance artists, visual artists, and writers are included in the collection.",

Also included are a number of photographs of class and student groups, University buildings, and portraits of Northwestern University Preparatory School students. Most of the prints are mounted on cardboard stock and range in size from approximately 4\" x 6\" to 4-1/2\" x 7\". Prints of buildings and student groups are sorted into alphabetically-arranged topics. Portraits of Northwestern faculty and administrators are arranged alphabetically by the subjects’ surnames. Portraits of students are arranged by their class year (year of graduation; for example, Class of 1878, Class of 1879, etc.) When multiple portraits exist for a given year they are alphabetized within folders by students’ surnames. Unidentified or partially identified portraits are at the end of the series. The series includes two copies of Hesler’s book, Photographic Views of Picturesque Evanston (1887).",

The program was to include Parker’s reading of the short story, “Horsie.” This 37th issue of the Fiction Review was the beginning of its third season on WFMT. Lefley begins this third season by providing some background information on the Fiction Review. Lefley explains that the province of the Fiction Review is serious fiction and that these programs explore the art of fiction and masters of the short story and novel. Lefley then provides a brief biographical background of Parker and a detailed description of her literary catalog. Dorothy Parker’s reading of “Horsie” is not included in this recording.",

Part One begins with portions of Faulkner’s remarks when he accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature. Lefley then provides a detailed biography of Faulkner which includes description of his literary catalog. Faulkner then reads from three of his novels: “The Sound and the Fury,” “The Wild Palms,” and “A Fable.” Part Three begins with Lefley providing biographical background on Faulkner and a description of his literary catalog. The rest of Part Three is devoted to readings by William Faulkner, including three excerpts from “As I Lay Dying” and two from “Light in August.”",

An attempt has been made to match slides to labels, but some of the content is not obvious; some titles have been supplied by the encoder and some labels from the index did not have obvious matches amongst the slides. A list of unmatched labels appears at the end of the inventory. List of index labels not matched to a specific slide: 1. Over the Transvaal to Kruger – 2. S. Hemsted, Londiani – 3.

Two slides are labeled ‘Prime Minister of Justice Mgwanya’, ‘Catholic Princes Joseph and Augustus’. Slides 8, 11, 12, and 13, labeled Zimbabwe ruins, are of the Great Zimbabwe archaeological site. The inside cover of the box has the handwritten label: \"Lantern slides for Lancelot Edgell Dashwood from Graeuice (sp?)\". Some of the slides are labeled with printed labels on the edge and many have handwritten labels on the glass themselves which repeat the printed labels. Handwritten dividers have been inserted to group the slides by topic, but some of these seem to have been misplaced over the years. The divider labeled \"Zanzibar\" grouped only three slides, two of which were clearly from Mombasa, so it is not referred to in the finding aid. ; 130 glass slides (each approximately 8 x 8 cm,), a few colored, some with identifying paper labels or ink inscriptions; five slides cracked but still stable; housed in a contemporary wooden box with hinged lid, metal catches.",

    "full_text": " Paris;le 24 août I939 Cher Monsieur, J'ai regu votre précieuse lettre dont la documentation me permet d'élaborer un plan de travail nouveau et de marcher d'un pas plus sûr dans la voie de mes recherches.Je vous remercie bien sincère- ment ainsi que Miss Andrews qui a eu la patience de copier cette fas- tidieuse liste. En attendant cette documentation, j'ai étudié le séjour d'Al- dridge en France.Le fameux banquet de Versailles réunissait une tren- taine de journalistes, hommes de lettres, directeurs de théâtres etc et cela n'a pas été une petite affaire de consulter toute la presse de l'époque .J'ai retrouvé la trace de notre inlassable voyageur dans I6 villes de province mais mes recherches ne sont pas terminées.Elles seront même très longues du fait que les bibliothèques départementales sont parfois plus riches, en documentation locale que la Nationale.D'ou nécessité d'écrire à chacune d'elles. Ainsi ferai-je avec l'Allemagne,Ia Pologne et autres pays qui ont vu jouer Aldridge. Dans ma thèse, je vous l'ai déjà dit ,j'étudie le jeu d'une guarantaine d'acteurs.Parmi les étrangers, Ira Aldridge fait déjà bonne figure. Il y est comparé à d'autres comédiens et gagne de ce fait un relief considérable. Mon étude qui traite de la création et du développe ment du métierede comédien individualiste en Russie -soit une période de 250 ans- je la termine par Vladimir Davydov qui, ses études universi- taires terminées s'engagea dans une troupe ambulante. Au cours de ses tournées il Tui fut donné de rencontrer Aldridge à Toula. Dans ses mémoires publiés en I925 écrit que toute sa carrière théatrale lui fut inspirée par le tragédien noir:Ira Aldridge.Ce sont des pages ma- gnifiques. personnellement connu Davydov en I9I4, et je le considè- re comme le plus grand acteur russe contemporain. Ma thèse soutenue à la Sorbonne, je m'empresserai de vous en envoyer un exemplaire ainsi qu'à Miss Aldridge.Je vous en demanderai une critique sérieuse. Selon votre appréciation nous la ferons traduire et éditer en anglais. Peut-être n'intéressera-t-elle pas l'Angleterre mais je suis assuré d'avance de son retentissement en Amérique où l'in- térêt pour la Russie théatrale est très grand. Je lis dans \"l'Era\" que vous m'avez si obligeamment envoyé que le Comte Tolstoi adressa quelques mots élogieux à Aldridge. Savez- vous que ce même Comte Tolstoi a fait la critique d'un spectacle où Aldridge jouait un rôle comique:celui d'un esclave au service d'un fermier.L'esclave arrive sur la scène écrasé sous le poids d'une im- mense corbeille qu'il dépose à terre avec d'infinies précautions.Quel- le n'est pas sa stupeur en en voyant sortir un jeune homme. Il se met à rire, il danse, il boit, il boit même jusqu'à l'ivresse et il s'endort. Le maître l'appelle à plusieurs reprises:terreur de l'esclave qui travers le trouble de ses pensées juge sa situation très grave et en entrevoit les terribles conséquences. Il essait de se tenir debout mais vainement les cris. furieux du maître l'affolent et le dégrisent.Le visage de l'artiste passait alors par toutes les transes etc sa mimi- CECT Instano`1 1940 931019 test after 191000 95 sometted el SW9T5ITA the .stall 92091513 9.1 97195 tasbaette all -09TJ xuens? 9J.907STT 019 925145 95 37151 sin 3130 to 55 aglice 95 @gffiv 105 IT ens 93 119,89001 eufo stored fito 2 9000300 izait UV too 61.0 to Jac at 95 9JISTJ to shottoo 8.102- steau ne methemos 95 T913sm vo5yvsc Timibs[V gatariet SI 91 -2018 OBS 890 900 eash agenturet tol se stuof first ITS adridua J 95 3mmo5 tit INI If STITION 91 ISO gérigant JUY 91 91 IIS vobyvs UNITOD 988UT IN9128 Basto aufa 91 error 97 119 ELOV samodro el é 986dj sM no 281M 6Yup femis an STINOBIT st Burn 97fov 900 330 as 297169 to agest DO supino A 119 708 95 SIDERS alue 9 alam steaut st INOC JOIOF ovne LIdo le sevein BUOV all st BITOIA 7 atom 2889758 IotaloT 9tmoo 91 9UD no 915279998 av 5 supitito 81 ftef B Total 93moo emem 95 9UD euvy aust US 9V81089 av 5 9I8I III tisuot 90086 abiou 91 81102 éastos st TUP 9VITTS 9VB/989 [T.9P od 90.09 III TITIOS fasyov as 019 Inscuta 88 2.00 Jagia 91 99V8 92193 980g95 SERVO elffedroo 9810m st to s'upent 9mêm tiod Iteftod 11,98085 stup 9V210294 9.5 6 9251sm 91 to 9VET BETT nottsutia 88 ann 8998490 292 95 9 ¥ also juoded 11993 918889 agiditist 89E trovertre 8I9VSTJ - 91. 91 to 9111sm uh xustur alto Jugmentsv -kmim st efg 891 ISO aroIs +182880 93. spacky 2 - que était si expressive qu'il mettait la salle en délire. Pourriez-vous m'indiquer quel est ce rôle,guelle est la pièce et quel en est l'auteur? L'éclipse de I833-38 que j'avais déjà dans ma documentation,je la retrouve dans la liste de Miss Andrews.Qu'a-t-il donc fait pendant ce ces cinq années? Fut-il, comme le prétendent les tusses,ministre de Jean-Pierre Boyer à St-Domingue? J'ai essayé de retrouver une critique de sa première représenta- tion au Coburg Theatre(mes notes disent qu'il fit ses débuts au Royal- ty Theatre ) en octobre I825.Les journaux n'en disent rien si ce n'est ceci: NEW TIMES Monday,oct IO,I825 Theatrical chit chat ...We understand that the African votary of Thespis whose delineations of Hamlet,Richard etc. at New-York, were so humorously imitated by Mr Mathews in his entertainment of \"A Trip to America\" is engaged at the Coburg Theatre, in a character of Oroonoko, in the play of that name, on Monday evening next:such an exhibition can scarcely fail to excite pu- blic curiosity. MORNING CHRONICLE Tuesday, II oct,I825 The Mirror of Fashions ...It is said that the African votary of Thespis, whose delineations of Hamlet, Richard etc. at New-York, were so humorously imitated by Mr Mathews, in his \"Trip to America\" is in England, and engaged at a mi- nor theatre. (Paris-Paper.) Sont-ce des allusions à Aldridge? J'ai beau feuilleter les journaux, jour par jour,C'est tout ce que je relève. En mars I826, (1e 23) un \"American gentleman\" dont c'est la première apparition sur la scène anglaise joue \"Gambia\" de \"L'Esclave\" avec un grand succès. Cet artiste dont on ne cite pas non plus le nom ne serait-il pas Aldridge? J'ai trouve des critiques de sa représentation en avril I833 au Covent-Garden et j'ai lu avec plaisir celles que vous me signaliez dans le Times et l'Athenaeum.,Te regrette bien que l'Era n'existe pas à la Nationale pas plus que le Theatrical News ni le Theatrical Jour- nal;madocumentation se serait encore enrichie. Cher Monsieur, je vous quitte en vous remerciant encore.Veuillez présenter mes hommages respectueux à Miss Andrews, et recevez l'assu- rance de mes sentiments dévoués et sincères Michel Kovatcheviter P.S. Je m'excuse de dactylographier mes lettres mais,mon écriture n'est pas assez lisible pour que je vous en impose la lecture.

    "description": "Memo dated 1968 July 9, from Festival Associate Director John Chambless to Barry Olivier, about the conduct of Stanley Elliott on July 4, 1968 at the 11th Annual Berkeley Folk Music Festival",
    "full_text": " BERRELEY FOLK MUSIC FESTIVAL PRESENTED BY THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SINCE 1958 BARRY OLIVIER, FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR U.C.STUDENT CENTER, BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA 94720 MEMORANDUM 9 July 1968 To: Barry Olivier, Festival Director From: John Chambless, Festival Associate Director 1. As you already know, on the evening of 4 July 1968, at the Dance program presented as part of the Festival, a certain amount of tension was expected, and various precautions were taken and plans made for orderly decision making in the event of any unusual occurances. 2. Several individuals, representing University, Associated Students, and Festival offices were designated and asked to be present at the Dance in question. a. The Associated Students representative was Mr. Stanley Elliott, Union Manager. b. The Sergeant in charge of the men assigned from the Campus Police office to the Dance, was to represent the Campus Police. C. The Dean of Students Office also appointed Mr. Stanley Elliott to represent them at the Dance. 3. At about 11:00 p.m. on the evening of 4 July, very strong requests came from concerned business and community leaders, asking that we open the Dance free to the public, in order to cool off the Telegraph Avenue situation which at that point had grown tense. 4. That decision was made, with the concurrance of those representatives of various offices present. 5. Without intending any personal attack, I think you should know that it was both my personal observation and the observation of Mr. Jim Frederick (A.S.U.C. Technical Operations Manager) and it was per- fectly obvious to anyone involved-- that Mr. Elliott was seriously intoxicated during our discussions, so that his speech was slurred and his manner was voluble, but quite unsteady. 6. In light of his being the sole representative of the Dean's Office and the Associated Students, I consider his condition quite in- appropriate. 7. I believe this matter should be kept in the utmost confidence. 555 MUCHANOMAY 388 ### 11.00 MOTICA 200 are badnessa guardian steried patrick adidas are sanger Isravel 885 LES 0.0 195 and 538 LAC 335 124 500 890 com to SAME 07 SEW 901.15 $1.15 1010000 cels 902220 to 0.63C out 3006 and on 10 ... 00:11 DATED OF 0.19 arga stoof sanT... 022 to $38 9.10 wonx JOY C 008 110 SERVIC 588 505 198 506 JOEVOO 265 dant 08 . are vometami adtup erts 25 993 TAS vises 315 I the 229 and 368 cost DEvote 530 295 *** Incress @@@ and 599 BFMFB22-F05-056 22-5-56 Linb",

    "scope_and_contents": "John Cage was already established as an influential American composer and important leader of post-World War II avant-garde music when he began his Notations project in the mid-1960s. In 1965 the Notations project was born. Cage sent letters to hundreds of composers, visual artists, and writers soliciting manuscripts for possible inclusion in a book to benefit the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts. Some sent Cage recent creations while others contributed older works. Cage published selections as Notations (New York: Something Else Press, 1969). In addition to the music manuscripts, the Notations collection includes much of the correspondence generated around this project. The collection offers unique insight into the notational practices developed by composers in the first two-thirds of the 20th century. Works by established composers, students, musicians, performance artists, visual artists, and writers are included in the collection.",

In 1965 the Notations project was born. Cage sent letters to hundreds of composers, visual artists, and writers soliciting manuscripts for possible inclusion in a book to benefit the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts. Some sent Cage recent creations while others contributed older works. Cage published selections as Notations (New York: Something Else Press, 1969). In addition to the music manuscripts, the Notations collection includes much of the correspondence generated around this project. The collection offers unique insight into the notational practices developed by composers in the first two-thirds of the 20th century. Works by established composers, students, musicians, performance artists, visual artists, and writers are included in the collection.",

    "scope_and_contents": "John Cage was already established as an influential American composer and important leader of post-World War II avant-garde music when he began his Notations project in the mid-1960s. In 1965 the Notations project was born. Cage sent letters to hundreds of composers, visual artists, and writers soliciting manuscripts for possible inclusion in a book to benefit the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts. Some sent Cage recent creations while others contributed older works. Cage published selections as Notations (New York: Something Else Press, 1969). In addition to the music manuscripts, the Notations collection includes much of the correspondence generated around this project. The collection offers unique insight into the notational practices developed by composers in the first two-thirds of the 20th century. Works by established composers, students, musicians, performance artists, visual artists, and writers are included in the collection.",

He has broadcast for many years on CBS radio and television his marvellous evocations of the folk charac- ters he has collected by ear and recording machine. He is a great plat- form performer, with a range from the deeply tragic to the ribald, and can charm any audience with two hours of stories, Negro sermons, etc. He has asked me to write a reccomendation to you. I can say that he has no peers in his field of folktale and folk characters. He hopes that you will be able to find some bookings for him. I strongly urge that you write or telephone him. Yours sincerely, Dantomax Alan Lomax Mr. Barry Olivier 2506 Hasta Berkeley, California John Henry Faulk John Henry Faulk Associates Perry-Brooks Building Austin, Texas laer b/ BFMF B36 F17-019 36-17-26",

Sullivan Photograph Collection is an extensive collection of photographs and slides of public and commercial buses and public transit and commuter trains, dating from 1946-2000. The bulk of the collection comprises photographs taken by Ronald J. Sullivan, an amateur photographer and rail and bus enthusiast; also included are historic images of Chicago-area transit that were part of Sullivan’s personal collection, and which supplement the photographer’s original material. The majority of the photographs were taken in Chicago, Illinois and the surrounding area, with a few in other cities and international locations. Sullivan documented nearly all of the photographs and slides in this collection in detail with bus or train numbers, route numbers, street intersections or stations, and dates.",

    "full_text": " Which gets me back to whom this is all about. The Airplane's amme Fisher- - problems are full-blown by now, but Country Joe and the Fish are just flashing warning sig- nals. They were out of tune on \"Bass Strings,\" \"Section 43,\" \"The Masked Marauder,\" and a few other numbers in their first set last Saturday at the Fillmore East. Sloppy? You think your ears have gone crazy. One new number-a put-down of New York which deserves to be a lot better, considering what they know of how New York can mess up your mind. One revision-a down-tempo \"Superbird,\" okay. Page Thirty-one Plus a funny rock baseball game Otherwise, the old favorites. I love that group. Love that wacky country sophistication. Love the way Joe strides around, owning the stage and owning the world, without a single sugges- tive gesture radiating more sex- uality than all the theatrical sex 9 symbols in the business. Man-like don't do it. The first 4 warning was in the inferior se- 5/2 cond album. Where is the new material? Where's the growth? Woodshedding, anyone? 68 Page Thirty-two 30-23-39 13FMF.030-F23-035",

However, all the evidence, particularly some of the commentary, points to their being the work of one or more of the members of the photographic team in the Corps of Engineers (see Object no. 3) and that the images were captured on the march to Magdala (which took place from January to April 1868). Sooroo, Senafie, Goongoona, Addigerat and Ashangi all feature in the route recorded in the Abyssinia album. ; The commentary on the reverse of several of the images (Nos. 1, 3, 5 & 21) provides reference to the military campaign and therefore compelling evidence in support of an attribution to the Royal Engineers. The images in the Abyssinia Campaign album are well-documented but no reference to the stereoscopic images has been found. The stereoviews are important, not only for their content but also for the early use of stereoscopic equipment in Africa; they may well be the earliest stereoviews of Abyssinia.",

    "scope_and_contents": "John Cage was already established as an influential American composer and important leader of post-World War II avant-garde music when he began his Notations project in the mid-1960s. In 1965 the Notations project was born. Cage sent letters to hundreds of composers, visual artists, and writers soliciting manuscripts for possible inclusion in a book to benefit the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts. Some sent Cage recent creations while others contributed older works. Cage published selections as Notations (New York: Something Else Press, 1969). In addition to the music manuscripts, the Notations collection includes much of the correspondence generated around this project. The collection offers unique insight into the notational practices developed by composers in the first two-thirds of the 20th century. Works by established composers, students, musicians, performance artists, visual artists, and writers are included in the collection.",

Sullivan Photograph Collection is an extensive collection of photographs and slides of public and commercial buses and public transit and commuter trains, dating from 1946-2000. The bulk of the collection comprises photographs taken by Ronald J. Sullivan, an amateur photographer and rail and bus enthusiast; also included are historic images of Chicago-area transit that were part of Sullivan’s personal collection, and which supplement the photographer’s original material. The majority of the photographs were taken in Chicago, Illinois and the surrounding area, with a few in other cities and international locations. Sullivan documented nearly all of the photographs and slides in this collection in detail with bus or train numbers, route numbers, street intersections or stations, and dates.",
