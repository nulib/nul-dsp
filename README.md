# Vector Viz Demo

Playground for testing front-end visualizations of vector clustering.

The goal is to visualize the clusters of the embeddings and the metadata in a way that is intuitive and informative.

## Data

The dataset is combination of metadata and vector embeddings of the metadata. The embeddings are generated using the [INSERT HERE] library.

`ndjson` data is generated by the `src/data/convert.ipynb` notebook (which can be ran inside VSCode in your dev env). Number of records created and the number of dimensions can be adjusted in the notebook. The default values are:

```python
output_row_count = 50
number_of_dimensions = 3
```

To access the source vectors file `src/data/vectors_full.ndjson` (and run the notebook), please contact Brendan or a member of the RDC team for a download link (~700MB).

Some sample output data is included in the `src/data` directory, to feed chart components:

```
src/data/vectors_tsne_2d_reduced.json
src/data/vectors_tsne_3d_reduced.json
...
```

## Setup

```bash
npm install

npm run dev

```
