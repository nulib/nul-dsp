# Vector Visualization Playground

Playground for testing front-end visualizations of vector clustering. 3-d Scatterplots are visualized using [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) and, and the 2-d scatterplot is visualized using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). This application is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) app using `app` routing and React Server Components (RSC).

The goal is to visualize the clusters of the embeddings and the metadata in a way that is intuitive and informative.

## Data

The dataset is combination of metadata and vector embeddings of the metadata from NUL digital Collections.

### Notebook

`ndjson` data is generated by the `src/data/convert.ipynb` notebook (which can be ran inside VSCode in your dev env). Number of records created and the number of dimensions can be adjusted in the notebook. The default values are:

```python
output_row_count = 50
number_of_dimensions = 3
```

To access the source vectors file `src/data/vectors_full.ndjson` (and run the notebook), please contact Brendan or a member of the RDC team for a download link (~700MB).

Some sample output data is included in the `src/data` directory, to feed chart components:

```
src/data/vectors_tsne_2d_reduced.json
src/data/vectors_tsne_3d_reduced.json
...
```

## Run the app

```bash
pnpm install

pnpm dev

```
